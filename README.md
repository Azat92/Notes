# Innermost Notes

*Only for you. Private. Always*

Have you ever imagined an app, that would store your personal ideas always only for you and never share them. Here we go - Notes will do exactly this for you! Here you can store your the most private ideas and never be worried, that they might leak on remote server or someone else can has access to read/modify/delete them. You will be able to share selected items via AirDrop and other common options in the upcoming versions, but everything will be manual and will never happen without your interaction.

In the same time, you receive well organized structure for your notes - you can group them by categories, and for every note you can attach unlimited amount of different types of payload: media files, date/time, geolocation and web links. You also will get beautiful previews of content your store and easy tool to maintain it. New payload types will be supported in new versions!

Try it now yourself and see how it can help you.
